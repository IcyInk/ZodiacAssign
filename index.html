		<p>The Chinese Zodiac is a cycle the repeats every twelve years, with each year representing a different animal. For a person to be born in the year of an animal of the zodiac means they will inherit the traits that are associated with that animal. There are a number of attributes associated with each animal, such as personality traits and relationships with other animals of the zodiac. As luck is a large part of Chinese culture, there are also many lucky and unlucky things that are specific to each animal, such as colors, numbers, flowers, directions, months and even years.</p>
		<p>There are many different stories on how the zodiac was created. One such story is a folk story involving animals racing across a river to be one of the 12 animals of the zodiac. Another involves a banquet being held and the order of the 12 animals being decided by when they arrived. Both of these stories describe why the cat is not one of the 12 animals of the zodiac, as he drowned in the river in the first story, and did not attend the banquet in the second story because he was tricked by the rat. The Buddhist belief is that the zodiac was created when only 12 animals came to bid him farewell. However, the true story of the zodiacâ€™s creation is unclear, as it was most likely developed over hundreds of years in the early stages of Chinese civilization.</p>
